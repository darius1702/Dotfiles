# Config files

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)
./install.sh requires [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

# Colors
- Most colors from [everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest)
- FG and BG from  [no-clown-fiesta](https://github.com/aktersnurra/no-clown-fiesta.nvim)

# TODO
- [ ] Add back 'gs' zsh alias to open neogit
    - Need to find a clean way to do it because neogit is lazy loaded only on '<leader>gs'
- [ ] Split i3 config into different files
    - Doesn't work on current version of i3 :(
- [ ] Try to move dmenu config here without breaking git
- [ ] Replace stow */ with individual calls, move scripts dir here

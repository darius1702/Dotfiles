# Config files

./install.sh requires [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)


# TODO
- [ ] Add back 'gs' zsh alias to open neogit
    - Need to find a clean way to do it because neogit is lazy loaded only on '<leader>gs'
- [ ] Split i3 config into different files
    - Doesn't work on current version of i3 :(
